# etch-a-sketch
Eric Thompson - 10/27/2023

Etch-a-Sketch project for The Odin Project Fundamentals Course. Current functionality includes click-to-draw, color selection, resizing number of grid pixels from 1x1 to 100x100, and clearing the canvas.

Future implementation may random color drawing, and progressive darkening of squares.
